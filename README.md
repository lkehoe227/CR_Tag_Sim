Estimating fishing mortality is challenging in catch-and-release recreational fisheries due to uncertainty associated with creel surveys, voluntary reporting, and discard mortality estimates. Tagging studies offer an approach to estimate exploitation rates independent of creel surveys and stock assessment models. Conventional and genetic tagging data were simulated with age-structured population and individual-based tagging models to determine the tagging effort and angler participation required to precisely estimate the discard exploitation rate, or the fraction of the stock caught-and-released. Models were parameterized with life history and fishery data from U.S. Atlantic red snapper, Lutjanus campechanus, a stock for which recreational discards are estimated to constitute >90% of fishery removals. Results from the Barker model indicate conventionally tagging 2,500 fish would estimate the catch-and-release probability parameter with a CV < 0.3. Genetic tagging was also able to produce precise estimates with participation from >2.5% (25,000 trips) of fishing effort, which is logistically prohibitive. Results indicated that conventional tagging performs better in fisheries such as Atlantic red snapper where catch is dominated by private vessels and is largely unobserved and decentralized.
